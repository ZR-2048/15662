(##) A3T1 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task.

This task is pretty simple and spend within several hours finishing that.

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a3.task1.cpp` file and 
checking that camera rays properly fill up the camera view frustrum.

(##) A3T2 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task.

This task is easier than BVH because what we need to do is just implement the intersection algorithm based on the slides provided and handled some edge cases.
Spend about half a day to finish the task.

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a3.task2.*.cpp` files and 
checking that rendering spheres and triangles works properly.

(##) A3T3 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task.

This task is the most difficult and time-consuming part. The first problem is to understand data structures, parameters that are passed in and returned.
The second problem is to fully understand what BVH mean, in class we only introduce conceptions but not implement details, I spend a lot of time understanding what to return,
what function to use, and most importantly, how to compute the best partition using compute_buckets method.
The ray intersection is also hard because at first I don't understand the whole process, what's the difference between bbox().hit and primitives.hit()? One returns a bool value
and the other returns a trace data. Why "front-to-back" method is faster? As I dive deeper, I get a better understanding.
Task 3 takes me almost have a week, yet still have no confidence that I implement all of them right.

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a3.task3.*.cpp` files and 
checking that the generated BVH looks reasonable and rendering large meshes is fast and correct.

(##) A3T4 FINAL

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a3.task4.*.cpp` files and 
checking that rendering lambertian materials look correct.

(##) A3T5 FINAL

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a3.task5.*.cpp` files and 
checking that rendering mirror, refract and glass materials look correct.

(##) A3T6 FINAL

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a3.task6.*.cpp` files and 
checking that there is an improvement between using task 4 direct lighting and using task 6 direct lighting.

(##) A3T7 FINAL

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a1.task7.*.cpp` file and 
checking that rendering scenes with environment lighting yields correct sampling.

(##) RENDERED IMAGE FINAL

Your image:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A3-writeup/reference/render-image.png" alt="Your creation">
</div>
