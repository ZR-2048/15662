* Replace reference images with your own screenshots or renders when applicable.

* Include descriptions of any encountered problems and the time you spent on each task.

(##) A4T1 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

This task is rather simple. Only need to implement the interpolation based on the algorithm provided in A4.md. One key problem that keeps
me confused is that I forget to normalize the calculation result to [0,1), which leads to some time debugging. It takes no more than 2 hours.

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a4.task1.cpp` file and 
checking that the spline interpolation looks correct.

(##) A4T2 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

I'm sorry that since it's near the end of spring semester, due to time limit and other dues, I can not figure the Inverse Kinematics correctly.
Another reason is that it takes a long time to understand useful functions offered and find useful data that are not presented in A4.md or comments.

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a4.task2.*.cpp` files and 
checking that moving the bones works correctly and IK is functional.

(##) A4T3 FINAL

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a4.task3.*.cpp` files and 
checking that the skeleton moves correctly when the bones are moved.

(##) A4T4 FINAL

Do you want to use the reference A3T2 solutions for this task: ____ (yes/no)

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a4.task4.*.cpp` files and 
checking that particle simulation behaves correctly and does not go through any surface.

(##) ANIMATED VIDEO FINAL

Your animation:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A4-writeup/reference/animation.mov" alt="Your creation">
</div>
Explanation of what it is and how you made it:

Any free model sources you need to credit?
